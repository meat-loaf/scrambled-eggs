Short-term todos:

* Figure out what to do with error message boxes
* Drawing appears to be a little wrong in some places -- check that we're drawing
	things with negative length (?) properly (see level A0, for example -- pipes drawn wrong)
* Finish level_object class so it's actually useful. Link it to level data and ensure
	it can only be moved by the user 8 pixels at a time
* Implement zoom (should be reasonably simple, QT should support this easily)
* Allow modifying level header (much simpler, is done in-place)

Longer term:
* Allow saving of modified levels so this isn't just a glorified level viewer.
	this involves finding a space in the ROM to put it if the level is bigger, potentially
	modifying the sprite/level tables, etc.
* ROM freespace tracker of some sort -- it would be nice for the user to easliy know how much
	space is left for individual levels, since we're stuck with the 2MB limit it seems.

more to come...

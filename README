Scrambled Eggs is a Level Editor for Yoshi's Island.

It requires QT5 to build. Simply run the build.sh script and it will
generate the makefile for you, then run `make'. Arguments to build.sh
are passed to make.

Currently, it only displays a (rough) grid of what the level objects look like,
and it currently doesn't display sprites. There is a lot of work to be done, still.
